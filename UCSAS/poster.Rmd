# WNBA Adjusted Plus-Minus Models

**David Teuscher and Brad Hymas**

**Abbreviated abstract:** Athletes are acquired and offered contracts based on individual performance, but for team sports, the athletes' performance is impacted by the other players on the court or field. Sports like basketball and football are difficult to determine the value of individual players because of the interactions between many different players at one time. Adjusted plus-minus models have been implemented in the NBA to evaluate individual player worth independent of a player's teammates. Similar models are not widespread for the WNBA and we implement adjusted plus-minus models for WNBA teams for the 2019 season to determine which players are the most valuable.  
  

# Problem and Data 

+ Explain the point of adjusted plus minus
	* Explain previous work in NBA, but lack of work in WNBA
	* Explain plus-minus and then APM and RAPM
	* Explain where the data is from
+ Ways to measure player value
